## About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on software development, driven by a passion for building meaningful digital solutions that improve services and create real value for people. My work blends clean, efficient code with an eye for usability and design, shaped in part by my earlier explorations in graphic design and videography. I enjoy approaching challenges with both technical precision and a creative mindset, aiming to bridge the gap between functionality and impactful user experiences.
